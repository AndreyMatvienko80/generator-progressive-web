# Progressive Web Generator

To generate a Progressive Web project, run the following command in the terminal:

```
bash <(curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobify/generator-progressive-web/master/generate.sh)
```

Note for Windows users: this requires Bash, and thus does not work in a DOS prompt. Please install git and use the git-bash terminal and run this command there.
